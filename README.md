# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on: LLM/VLM-driven autonomy for robots — turning natural-language goals into robust multi-robot behavior using vision-based localization, motion planning (RRT*), and closed-loop control (Pure Pursuit + PID), with embedded bridges for real hardware.<br><br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: end-to-end robotics systems that combine perception + planning + control — multi-robot coordination, mapping/SLAM, and embedded integration (ESP32/STM32) with clean interfaces.<br><br>🤝 I’m looking for help with: making systems more deployment-ready: calibration/benchmarking, robustness to drift/slip, and improving real-time reliability (latency, jitter, comms).<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning: stronger control (LQR/MPC/NMPC), better state estimation (VIO/SLAM), and scalable robotics software architecture.<br><br>💬 Ask me about: OpenCV (ArUco/ChArUco), sensor fusion (IMU + encoders), planning (A*, RRT*, Hybrid A*), control (PID/LQR basics), embedded comms (Wi-Fi/BLE/ESP-NOW), and integrating all of it into working robots.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact: I’ve built systems ranging from a 110 kV field robot (vision + thermal inspection) to a mapping robot that streams live sensing into a visualization stack.
